Description: Designed for the popular USGS MODFLOW Finite Difference
    groundwater flow simulation software (http://water.usgs.gov/ogw/modflow/).
    There are functions to read binary output data arrays into R objects or
    NetCDF files (using the RNetCDF package).  There are functions for reading
    input files which contain important simulation information and for writing
    input files from R objects.  Other functions are utility functions that
    allow analysis and visualisation of data.  These functions have been
    developed more or less as I have required them. If you would like to see a
    feature added, then e-mail me.
